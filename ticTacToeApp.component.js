Regardless of what decision is made at the end of the trial, I foresee walking away with lots of valuable experience  -- not only with expanding my web development skill set, but also gaining insight into the start up world. I'm pretty stoked at the opportunity to learn from more experienced engineers and other members of Pear Deck, and I also hope that I can be productive and contribute to the company. In order for the trial to be successful, I would reach all milestones laid out in this document and meet all other expectations -- and hopefully surpass a few!
